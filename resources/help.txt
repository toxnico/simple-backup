Welcome to Simple Backup !

Here is how to run the backup process :
java -jar simple-backup.jar path/to/config.edn

This minimalistic backup program uses rsync in background.
It allows you to define sets of folders to back up, and for each of this set, a list of destinations.

You can also customize the rsync options.

A configuration file being clearer than an explanation, there you go :
(edn format, indented to avoid scaring anyone)

{
  :rsync-options "-avt"
  :items
  [
    {
      :src ["/home/nico/Apps" "/home/nico/bin"]
      :dst ["/mnt/remote-server-1/backups" "/mnt/remote-server-2/backups"]
    }

    {
      :src ["/var/www"]
      :dst ["/mnt/remote-server-1/www-backups"]
    }
  ]
 }
